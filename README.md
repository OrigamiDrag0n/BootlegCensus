# BootlegCensus
A census of all bootleg uploads onto LiveBootlegConcert, visualised using the WordCloud module. This code creates a word-cloud of the number of uploads of each band/artist on a bootlegging site; there are 5943 different uploads in total, of almost every major band from Kasabian to Kraftwerk.

The bootlegging site can be found at https://livebootlegconcert.blogspot.com/

## DISCLAIMER:
This code does not under any conditions endorse bootlegging, as it is illegal
and threatens the integrity of the music industry, which is already struggling
as a result of lockdown and defunding of the arts. Please use this code with
caution, as this brief project was purely made out of curiosity.
